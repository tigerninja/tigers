                Poaching is probably the oldest threat that the tiger has faced in its entire existence. Poaching 

is the act of hunting wild animals illegally. For hundreds of years motivation for the hunted 

tiger has been recreation and shielding livestock. The poaching business is lucrative and 

rewarding for some people.  </p>

A poached tiger could go for about "$100,000" on the black market 

(Sinha). Poachers come about for many different reasons: the tiger's skin and bones are an

extraordinary prize for some wealthy people and impressive to observe. Another 

motivation for poaching is that "Traditional Chinese Medicine practiced all over 

the world, in London, New York and San Francisco as well as the back streets of Shanghai- uses 

ground tiger bone as an analgesic (Mills)."

Most of the entire Chinese population performs 

Traditional Chinese Medicine for which tiger body parts are necessary. The user of these ancient 

techniques needs to find suppliers who "may be organized poaching gangs that deliberately hunt 

tigers or simply local villagers who sometimes opportunistically shoot or poison tigers in their 

neighborhoods (Karanth)." The high demand of the tiger's body parts gives poachers

incentive to hunt down tigers.</p>

 There are many ways in which these poachers hunt tigers.  The indigenous tribes that 

reside in Asia have been on the hunt for tigers for centuries. In the past they would use their 

familiarity with the beast's behavior and understanding of their land. They enforced the use of 

"cooperative hunting," hunting in a group in order to ambush a tiger (Karanth). These techniques 

quickly disappeared once the firearm was introduced. As soon as guns became easily available to 

the locals it was a much easier task to kill a tiger. A tiger's strength comes from its paws and 

teeth, therefore, when a man uses a firearm to shoot a tiger, the latter is rendered completely harmless 

and out of reach of retaliation.</p>

As of late poachers have structured squads as they pass illegally through 

protected tiger reserves. The poaching of a tiger is punishable by law.  Yet many of the 

offenders do not serve their sentences and return to their crimes since the 

lawsuits are more often than not, are adjourned.
